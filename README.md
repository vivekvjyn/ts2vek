# Representation Learning for Carnatic Music Transcription

This repository contains experiments to identify the most effective **svara** representation in the embedding space for use in Carnatic music transcription and other downstream tasks.
State-of-the-art deep representation learning models for time series have been adapted to incorporate contextual information from performances in the representation.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivekvjyn/representation-learning.git
cd representation-learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run experiments

```bash
./run.sh
```
